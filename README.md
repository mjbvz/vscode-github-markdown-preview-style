Changes VS Code's built-in markdown preview to match GitHub's styling.

![](https://github.com/mjbvz/vscode-github-markdown-preview-style/raw/master/docs/example.png)

Includes support for both light and dark GitHub themes. By default, the theme type (light vs dark) is selected based on your VS Code theme.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This extension only styles the Markdown preview. Use [this extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview) to add support for other GitHub markdown features like `:emoji:` and `- [ ] tasklists`.

# Features

- Preview what your markdown will look like on GitHub.
- Extends VS Code's built-in markdown preview.
- Includes Github's Dark and Light themes, along with Github's dark dimmed, high contrast, and color blind accessible themes.
- Customize styling using your own [`markdown.styles`](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown#_using-your-own-css) css
  - Make sure you apply your styles to the `.github-markdown-body` instead of just `body` so they don't get overridden by this extension

# Usage

Please see the [VSCode Markdown Preview documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) for instructions on how to use this extension.

# Configuration

By default, this extension uses the Github theme that matches VS Code's color theme (light/dark). These settings let you further customize which Github theme the Markdown preview uses.

- `markdown-preview-github-styles.colorTheme`

   Sets the color theme mode for the styling of the Markdown preview. Default: `auto`.

   - `Auto (match editor)`: Automatically match the editor color theme (light/dark).
   - `System`: Sync to the system/OS color theme.
   - `Single theme: Light`: Always use the selected Light theme. See `markdown-preview-github-styles.lightTheme`
   - `Single theme: Dark`: Always use the selected Dark theme. See `markdown-preview-github-styles.darkTheme`

- `markdown-preview-github-styles.lightTheme` and `markdown-preview-github-styles.darkTheme`.

   Specify the theme used when in Light/Dark mode. Only the matching setting applies when `colorTheme` is in `Single theme` mode.
   
   Available themes:

   - Light - `light`
   - Light high contrast - `light_high_contrast`
   - Light Protanopia & Deuteranopia - `light_colorblind`
   - Light Tritanopia - `light_tritanopia`
   - Dark - `dark`
